## Features
This project includes both centralized and distributed implementations of our Dispersion Formation Control algorithm.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, simply run:

```bash
python install.py
```
### Additional Dependencies
Some additional dependencies, such as LaTeX fonts and FFmpeg, may be required. We recommend following the installation instructions provided in the ```ssl_simulator``` [README](https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator/blob/master/README.md). 

To verify that all additional dependencies are correctly installed on Linux, run:
```bash
bash test/test_dep.sh
```

## Usage

For an overview of the project's structure and to see the code in action, we recommend running the Jupyter notebook `simulations.ipynb` located in the `notebooks` directory.
